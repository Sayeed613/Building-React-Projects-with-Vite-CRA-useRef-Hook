# useRef Hook Demo

## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of the `useRef` hook in React through three scenarios:
1. Focusing an input field on component mount.
2. Managing an uncontrolled input field and displaying its value in real-time.
3. Interacting with a DOM element to change its background color on click.

## Learnings
- The `useRef` hook is useful for persisting values between renders without causing re-renders.
- It is an excellent tool for accessing and interacting with DOM elements directly.
- Managing uncontrolled components with `useRef` provides a simpler alternative to controlled components in certain scenarios.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server.

## Components
- **FocusableInput**: Focuses the input field on mount.
- **UncontrolledInput**: Displays the current value of an input field in real-time.
- **ColorChanger**: Changes the background color of a div on click.
